### Description
Vouch is a browser-native AI platform that brings powerful intelligence directly into any webpage you visit.
No copy-pasting, no tab switching, no re-explaining. Highlight a claim and verify it, scan an article for bias, or chat with the page directly. The intelligence comes to you.

### Problem: Context Switching Fatigue
Reading online today is frustrating. You see claims you want to verify, jargon you don't understand, or bias you want to spot, but current AI tools break your flow. You have to copy text, open new tabs, paste content, and repeatedly explain context.

### Solution: Browser-Native AI Intelligence
Vouch changes this completely. It works natively inside your browser. The AI automatically understands the current page, so you can highlight text, ask questions, or run full analysis with zero friction. The result is a seamless experience that feels like having a personal research assistant always available on every site.

### Features

#### Core Browser Experience
- Works on any webpage instantly without needing to paste URLs or to provide extra context at all.
- "Vouch This" feature: Highlight any text and right-click to get instant, targeted AI analysis with search-grounded verification
- Real-time full page scanning that extracts and evaluates key claims with clear verdicts

#### Live Interaction and Highlights
- Smart yellow highlighting on the original page with one-click navigation to the exact location
- Context-aware conversational chat that maintains full understanding of the current article for follow-up questions

#### Advanced AI Analysis
- Bias scored 0-100 with political leaning detection, sentence-level manipulation flagging, and opinion-as-fact identification.
- Search grounding using live web data to reduce hallucinations and provide reliable sources
- Streaming responses for natural, real-time conversation flow
